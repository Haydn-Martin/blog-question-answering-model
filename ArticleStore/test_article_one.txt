The BoE was formed in 1694 to help finance the war vs. France. Its modern purpose is to be the bank of banks (and the government). The idea is to separate the monetary from the fiscal: a government with the ability to issue debt and then basically set the interest on that debt was too much power for said government to have. The BoE would “work together” with the gov. to “manage” the economy, with the ability to keep gov. raising of money via debt issuance in check by kicking them up the arse with interest rates.
