In theory. In reality, the BoE does what the gov. tells them to. It’s sort of like driving with your mate’s foot on the break and telling him when to contract his right quadricep and gastrocnemius. Why not just have your foot on the break instead? You would certainly have more control of the vehicle. But if you’re drunk or falling asleep or looking at a nice BMW overtaking you on the M3, it might be beneficial to have a second pair of eyes on the road and an external foot on the brake. That’s the idea.
