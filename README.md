This is a basic set-up: scrape the blog posts, save the content, and use a QA model to retrieve verbatim answers locally. Easy improvements would include more efficient storage/retrieval, conversion to RAG, moving from the NB to scripts, and deployment to blog. I will re-visit this with these in mind at some point in the future.
